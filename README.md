# 🔧 Stop Valve Design Project

## 📌 Overview
This project presents the 3D modeling and motion simulation of a **Stop Valve**, a mechanical device used to control or completely stop fluid flow in pipeline systems. The design is suitable for industrial water, gas, and moderate-pressure fluid applications.

The stop valve operates using a threaded stem that moves a disc linearly to open or block flow. The assembly was created using standard valve components and industry-compatible material selection.
